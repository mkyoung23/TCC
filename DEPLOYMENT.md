- [ ] Test capsule creation
- [ ] Test video upload
- [ ] Test video playback when unsealed
- [ ] Test invite functionality
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Verify Firebase dependencies are properly linked
   - Check code signing configuration
   - Clean build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)

2. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify GoogleService-Info.plist is included in bundle
   - Check Firebase project configuration
   - Ensure app bundle ID matches Firebase configuration

3. **Permission Denials**
   - Verify usage descriptions in Info.plist
   - Test permission flows on device
   - Check camera/microphone access

## Distribution Options

### 1. TestFlight (Recommended for testing)

- 90-day testing period
- No App Store review required for internal testing

### 2. Ad Hoc Distribution
- Up to 100 devices per year
- Requires device UUIDs
- Good for small team testing

### 3. App Store

- Requires App Store review
- Worldwide availability

## Post-Launch

### Analytics and Monitoring

### Updates
- Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, etc.)
- Test updates thoroughly before release
- Communicate changes to users

## Support

For technical issues:
- Check Firebase documentation
- Review Apple Developer documentation
