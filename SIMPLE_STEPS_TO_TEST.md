- Check App Store Connect - is the build there?

### "Build failed in CodeMagic"
- Copy the error message
- Send it to me
- I'll fix it and we'll rebuild

### "TestFlight says 'No apps available'"
- Build might still be processing

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL

1. ✅ Build it (CodeMagic does this)
2. ✅ Install it (TestFlight on your iPhone)
3. ✅ Test it thoroughly (you decide if it's good)
4. ✅ If perfect → invite friends
5. ✅ If issues → I fix them → rebuild → test again

---

You don't need a Mac. You don't need Xcode. You just need:

- ✅ Your Windows computer (to manage CodeMagic)
- ✅ Your iPhone (to test the app)
