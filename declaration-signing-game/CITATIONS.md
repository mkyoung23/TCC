## Historical Methodology and Evidence Standards

### What We Know vs. What We Don't Know

**Confirmed by Multiple Sources:**
- August 2, 1776 formal signing date
- John Hancock signed first as President of Continental Congress
- Timothy Matlack engrossed the parchment copy
- Green baize table coverings in Assembly Room
- Windsor chairs used in Assembly Room
- July 8, 1776 first public reading by John Nixon
- July 9, 1776 reading to Washington's troops in New York
- Washington's General Orders directing Declaration be read to all brigades

**Best Evidence Reconstruction:**
- Assembly Room seating arrangement (exact positions unknown)
- Specific dialogue (paraphrased from documented sentiments in letters/papers)
- Daily routines and lodging details (based on correspondence and records)

**Popular Legends vs. Evidence:**
- **Liberty Bell ringing on July 8**: Popular 19th-century legend; no contemporary accounts document bell ringing
- **Hancock's "King George will read that" comment**: Popular legend; no contemporary documentation
- **Trumbull painting as signing scene**: Depicts June 28 presentation, not August 2 signing

### Historical Accuracy Commitments

1. **No Fabricated Events**: Every scene and interaction is based on documented historical events or reasonable inference from period evidence.

2. **Source Transparency**: Every element in the game includes source identification available through F1 key overlay.

3. **Legend Identification**: Popular legends are clearly marked and only appear when "Legend Mode" is activated.

4. **Uncertainty Acknowledgment**: When historical record is incomplete (like Assembly Room seating), this is explicitly noted to players.
